CalendarTrigger
---------------

Trigger actions on your Android device based on calendar events

This is initially a clone of RemiNV/CalendarMute.

However my intention is to create a version which can trigger different actions on different types of calendar
event, and which handles overlapping events wanting different states in a sensible way (the "strongest" state
wins). This will require a preferences format incompatible with the original calendar mute, hence the need for a
new repo.
